// important architectures in software development;

1. Monolith service architecture:
Everything should be in a single system-- service layer,data layer,UI layer etc;
(disadvantage= even for slight update it will rebuild the entire software program);

2. service oriented architecture:
create different service layers independent to each other;

loose coupling:  these layers should not be completely dependent on each other because its possible that we may want to scale only some service layers not the other layers integrated with this layer;

its more suitable for companies that provides instant solution ;

ESB: Enterprise service bus for communicating between different services to oraganize the whole software to work;

3. Micro service architecture:
It divides the different services even further; its highly scalable and performance efficient;

event driven architecture through service bus for asynchronous calls between services;
